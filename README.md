Project 1 - Expense Reimbursement System
Project Description
The Expense Reimbursement System webapp manages the processing of reimbursing employees for expenses. Employees in the company can register, log in, and submit requests for reimbursement including a description, amount, and type. Managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and optionally filter by employee. They can deny or approve requests, and both managers and employees can view pending and resolved requests to which they have access.
